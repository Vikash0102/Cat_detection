# Cat_detection

This project demonstrates cat detection using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to detect cats in images. The implementation utilizes pre-trained Haar cascade classifier and draw bounding boxes around cats present in the input images.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have  installed:
1. OpenCV

You can install the required packages using command: 
```bash
  pip install opencv-python
```

##  Training the Model
The Haar cascade classifier used in this project is pre-trained.
### Haar Cascade Classifiers
Haar cascades are a machine learning object detection method used to identify objects in images or video. They are based on the Haar wavelet technique, which is a mathematical concept used in image processing. Haar cascades are trained from positive and negative images to detect specific objects, such as faces, eyes, or in your case, cats.
